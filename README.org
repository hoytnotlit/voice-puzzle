Voice puzzle - final project for course LT2216 spring 2021 (gussuvmi)

Pieces of a puzzle are rotated randomly. The player must rotate the pieces back in place using voice commands only. One should indicate the following:
- The piece to rotate
- How much to rotate (once, twice, three times/90, 180, 270 degrees)
- Direction to rotate (clockwise/counter clockwise)

The player can say everything in one utterance or parts only. The system will ask for missing information.

The player can choose to play in “hard”-mode, which means that they only have a limited amount of turns - every rotation must be correct. 

The player can also choose a different images for the puzzle.
